# Spring boot CRUD Boilerplate
This is a web application boilerplate that provides a quick and easy setup for creating RESTful APIs with a database backend. It includes a basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application structure, as well as support for database migrations. 

The boilerplate is designed to be used as a starting point for developing modern web applications quickly and easily, allowing for rapid prototyping and development. It is also designed to be extensible and customizable, as the user can add their own custom features and functionality.

Swagger UI is implemented to test the rest apis.
